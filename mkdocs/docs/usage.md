#Usage

This page provides a user an interface to input project information and have it signed and submitted to the pds.

To create a project the user must input the form schema and project JSON files that were emailed to them in the respective text boxes. After this the user must press sign and create project so that the ixo keysafe extension can be opened. Once the user confirms that the data is correct the project will be posted to the PDS at http://beta.elysian.ixo.world:5000/. After this the user will then be redirected to the ixo beta website.
